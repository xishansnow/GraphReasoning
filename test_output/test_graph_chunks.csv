"Silk is a natural protein fiber produced by silkworms. It has exceptional mechanical properties
    due to its hierarchical structure. Beta-sheets are the primary structural motif that provides
    strength to silk fibers. The crystalline regions formed by beta-sheets are embedded in an
    amorphous matrix. Spider silk is even stronger than silkworm silk and can stretch significantly
    before breaking. The combination of strength and elasticity makes silk an ideal material for"|f1829bfa722c4f3a8afcba442635aadb
